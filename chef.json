    "description": "When the James Beard award winning restaurant Vetri asked me to develop a custom blend to match their cuisine and authentic Italian atmosphere, I was excited and nervous all at once. I had created custom blends before, however this was a great honor.

On the other hand I knew the chef was very determined, willful, and not very delicate in his words.",
